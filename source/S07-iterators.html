<h1 id="Laziness_and_Eagerness">Laziness and Eagerness</h1>
<div id="Laziness_and_Eagerness_CONTENT">
<p>As we all know, one of the primary virtues of the Perl programmer is
laziness.  This is also one of the virtues of Perl itself.  However,
Perl 6 knows better than to succumb to false laziness, and so is eager
sometimes, and lazy others.</p>
<p>One thing that Perl understands is the difference between Laziness and
Eagerness.  When something is Lazy, it says &quot;just give me what you've
got; I'll get the rest later&quot;, whereas when it's eager, it says &quot;More!
More!  Give me everything you can get!&quot;.</p>
<p>Perl 6 defines 4 levels of laziness:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Strictly Lazy</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Does not evaluate anything unless explicitly required by the user,
including not traversing non-lazy objects.  This behavior is generally
available only by pragma or by explicit programming with non-lazy
primitives.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Mostly Lazy</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Try to obtain available items without causing eager evaluation of other
lazy objects.  However, the implementation is allowed to do batching
for efficiency.  The programmer must not rely on circular side effects when
the implementation is working ahead like this, or the results will
be indeterminate.  (However, this does not rule out pure <i>definitional</i>
circularity: if a list is bound to the name of an array, earlier
array values may be used in the definition of subsequent values.)</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Mostly Eager</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Obtain all &quot;easy&quot; items, defined as all leading items that are (easily)
provable to represent a finite number of values (even if the exact
number is not known in advance).  The remainder of the items are
left for lazy evaluation.  For constructs that are not known either
to be finite or infinite, the implementation is allowed, but not
required, to work ahead some number of elements in a batching mode.
If such a batch proves to terminate, the list may continue to with
eager evaluation of subsequent elements.  As with the &quot;mostly lazy&quot;
case, the programmer must not depend on circular side effects in
any situation where the implementation is allowed to work ahead.
Note that there are no language-defined limits on the amount of
conjectural evaluation allowed, up to the size of available memory;
however, an implementation may allow the arbitrary limitation of
workahead by use of pragams.</p>
		<p>I/O from a file may generally be assumed to be finite, but I/O
from a socket may not.  However, since the definition of &quot;finite&quot;
is somewhat dependent on available memory, a file that is too big
may be reasonably be treated lazily.  In any case, there should be no
profound semantic differences between &quot;mostly lazy&quot; and &quot;mostly eager&quot;.
They are primarily just hints to the implementation as to whether
you are likely to want to use all the values in the list.  Nothing
transactional should be allowed to depend on the difference.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Strictly Eager</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Obtain all items, failing immediately with an appropriate message
if asked to evaluate any data structures known to be infinite.
(Data structures that are effectively infinite but not provably
so will likely exhaust memory instead.)
This behavior is generally available only by pragma or by explicit
programming primitives.</p>
	</dd>
</dl>
<p>It's important to realize that the responsibility of determining the
level of laziness/eagerness in each operation is external to each lazy
object; the runtime, depending on which operation is being performed,
is going to assume an appropriate level of laziness and perform the needed
operations to apply that level.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="The_laziness_level_of_some_common_op">The laziness level of some common operations</h2>
<div id="The_laziness_level_of_some_common_op-2">
<dl>
	<dt>List Assignment: my @a = @something;</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>In order to provide p5-like behavior in list assignment, this
operation is performed in the Mostly Eager level, meaning that if you do</p>
<pre>  my @a = grep { ... }, @b;
</pre>
		<p>the grep will be evaluated as long as @b is not infinite.</p>
<pre>  my @a = grep { ... }, 1, 2, 3, 4..*
</pre>
		<p>will give grep an infinite list (even if the first elements are
known), therefore it will also be lazy. On the other hand</p>
<pre>  my @a = grep { ... }, 1, 2, 3, 4;
</pre>
		<p>will be eagerly evaluated.</p>
		<p>Despite the fact that &quot;mostly eager&quot; treats some iterators as potentially
infinite, a list assignment to multiple targets forces evaluation (by demand)
of enough of the list to fill any scalar destinations before a final &quot;slurpy&quot;
destination.  Hence:</p>
<pre>($a, $b, @c) = 1..*;
</pre>
		<p>takes the lazy iterator returned by the right side and forces it to divulge
a <code>1</code> and a <code>2</code> before setting up <code>@c</code> to mean <code>3..*</code> lazily.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Feed operators: my @a &lt;== @something;</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>The feed operator is strictly lazy, meaning that no operation should
be performed before the user requests any element. That's how</p>
<pre>  my @a &lt;== grep { ... } &lt;== map { ... } &lt;== grep { ... } &lt;== 1, 2, 3
</pre>
		<p>is completely lazy, even if 1,2,3 is a fairly small known compact
list.</p>
	</dd>
</dl>
<p>But it's important to notice that eagerness takes precedence over
laziness, meaning that</p>
<pre>  my @a = grep { ... } &lt;== map { ... } &lt;== grep { ... } &lt;== 1, 2, 3
</pre>
<p>Will be eagerly evaluated, but that is still different from</p>
<pre>  my @d = 1,2,3;
  my @c = grep { ... }, @d;
  my @b = map { ... }, @c;
  my @a = grep { ... }, @b;
</pre>
<p>Because in the first, the processing would be made as a flow, avoiding
the creation of the intermediary eager lists that the second example
creates. On the other hand</p>
<pre>  my @d &lt;== 1,2,3;
  my @c &lt;== grep { ... }, @d;
  my @b &lt;== map { ... }, @c;
  my @a = grep { ... }, @b;
</pre>
<p>provides the same laziness level of the first example.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="The_List_Role">The List Role</h1>
<div id="The_List_Role_CONTENT">
<p>The <code>List</code> role represents the lazy access to a list, walking through:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Data structure (list, tree, table, etc)</dt>
	<dt>Feed (map, grep, etc)</dt>
	<dt>Stream (mostly for IO)</dt>
	<dt>In fact, any value that wants to behave like a list</dt>
</dl>
<p>It's important to realize that the iterator of a list is the list
itself; Perl does not distinguish the two concepts.  Any type
that supports the <code>List</code> role is an iterator.</p>
<p>The methods in this role are:</p>
</div>
<h2 id="method_get">method get {...}</h2>
<div id="method_get_CONTENT">
<p>Used to iterate over a flat list (the context supplied by a slurpy binding).
Returns the next element from the iterator after flattening any leading parcel.</p>
<p>When the iterator runs out of elements, it will fail with the <code>EMPTY</code> exception.
As with most failures, <code>EMPTY</code> is generally returned without throwing it,
unless the calling lexical scope requests it to be thrown via &quot;use fatal&quot;.
No list should ever contain the <code>EMPTY</code> exception, since iterational
control flow should always terminate when that value is returned.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="method_batch_max">method batch ($max?) {...}</h2>
<div id="method_batch_max_CONTENT">
<p>Used to iterate over a flat list when you wish to return an arbitrary
number of elements at a time.  The returned set of elements is guaranteed
not to contain any <code>Parcel</code> objects, since any such <code>Parcel</code> will
be flattened before returning its elements.</p>
<p>Returns the batch of elements in some appropriate <code>Positional</code> type that
numerifies to the exact number of items returned. (The type may also
be <code>Iterable</code> in its turn.)  Also returns <code>EMPTY</code> if no arguments
are available; the <code>EMPTY</code> exception should return 0 when numerified
to facilitate numeric end testing if that is desired.  If <code>$max</code> is
not supplied, the iterator may choose a suitable batch size.</p>
<p>This method provides list context to the iterator.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="method_getarg">method getarg {...}</h2>
<div id="method_getarg_CONTENT">
<p>Returns the next parcel or other object from the iterator without
any flattening.  It is used both for binding to positional parameters
in item context as well as variadically retrieving slice elements in
slice context.</p>
<p>When it runs out of objects, it will fail with the <code>EMPTY</code> exception.
As with most failures, it is generally returned without throwing it,
unless the calling lexical scope requests it to be thrown via &quot;use fatal&quot;.
No list should ever contain the <code>EMPTY</code> exception, since iterational
control flow should always terminate when that value is returned.</p>
<p>Note: <code>get</code> and <code>getarg</code> must be atomic for any iterator shared
by more than one thread, since it is likely that message passing is
implemented in terms of them.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="method_batcharg_max">method batcharg ($max?) {...}</h2>
<div id="method_batcharg_max_CONTENT">
<p>Returns a batch of parcels/objects in some appropriate <code>Positional</code> type that
numerifies to the exact number of items returned. (The type may also
be <code>Iterable</code> in its turn.)  Also returns <code>EMPTY</code> if no arguments
are available; the <code>EMPTY</code> exception should return 0 when numerified
to facilitate numeric end testing if that is desired.  If <code>$max</code> is
not supplied, the iterator may choose a suitable batch size.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="method_flat">method flat {...}</h2>
<div id="method_flat_CONTENT">
<p>This returns an iterator that always flattens by calling <code>.get</code> internally
(which discards any parcel structure, returning only the parcel's elements).
The returned iterator will always return the same value regardless of
whether you call <code>.get</code> or <code>.getarg</code>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="method_slice">method slice {...}</h2>
<div id="method_slice_CONTENT">
<p>This returns an iterator that always anti-flattens by calling <code>.getarg</code> internally,
then hiding any resulting parcel by turning it into a <code>Seq</code> before returning it externally.
A list of <code>Parcel</code> is thereby transformed into a list of <code>Seq</code>.
The returned iterator will always return the same value regardless of
whether you call <code>.get</code> or <code>.getarg</code>.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="The_List_PushBack_Role">The List::PushBack Role</h1>
<div id="The_List_PushBack_Role_CONTENT">
<p>This role defines an iterator that knows how to receive values back to
be consumed again as if they were never consumed. The iterator is free
to refuse values that were not consumed first and in the correct
order, since this role is not intended to modify the original data,
only to modify the traversal of that data.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="method_pushback_value">method pushback($value) {}</h2>
<div id="method_pushback_value_CONTENT">
<p>This pushes $value back to the array. If this iterator is proxying
immutable data, it is free to refuse a value that is either out of the
original order or if it wasn't consumed. In that case, it should fail
with UnorderedPushBackException or BadPushBackException.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="The_List_Unshift_Role">The List::Unshift Role</h1>
<div id="The_List_Unshift_Role_CONTENT">
<p>This role defines an iterator that can receive new elements in the top
of the stack, it works like pushback, but it should be able to store
objects that are completely new to this stream. Either by being backed
by a mutable list or by providing a local stack. This role implies
List::PushBack, where pushback will be handled by unshift.</p>
<p>The purpose of defining two different Roles is to give the user the
&quot;expect to fail&quot; or &quot;expect to succeed&quot; semantics.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="method_unshift_value">method unshift($value) {}</h2>
<div id="method_unshift_value_CONTENT">
<p>This unshifts $value either to the backed list or to a local stack of
the iterator.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="Auxiliary_Implementations">Auxiliary Implementations</h1>
<div id="Auxiliary_Implementations_CONTENT">
<p>Perl's built-ins require that a number of auxiliary types implement
Lists.  These are available for general use, and are instantiated
by ending a feed at a scalar, array, or sliced array.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="Generic_Item_Iterator">Generic Item Iterator</h2>
<div id="Generic_Item_Iterator_CONTENT">
<p>To create a generic item iterator, end a feed in a scalar:</p>
<pre>  my $it &lt;== @a;
</pre>
<p>You can later do:</p>
<pre>  my $item = $it.get;
  my @items = @$it;
</pre>

<p>(XXX TODO:</p>
<pre>   What's this do?

   my $it &lt;== @a; my $it2 &lt;== $it; my $it3 &lt;== $it; get $it2; get $it3;

   ...allow tag team suckling?

   Is it worth the dwim, or do we just forbid it?
</pre>
<p>)</p>
</div>
<h2 id="Generic_Lazy_List">Generic Lazy List</h2>
<div id="Generic_Lazy_List_CONTENT">
<p>To obtain a generic lazy list, end a feed in a <code>Positional</code>.</p>
<pre>my @it &lt;== 1..2000;
</pre>
<p>The generic lazy list consumes the feed on demand.  As the elements of
the list are accessed, values that were in each subsequently returned
<code>Capture</code> are placed at the end of the <code>Positional</code>.  If a <code>Capture</code>
with more than one value is returned, each value is stored at its own
index.  Empty <code>Capture</code>s have no effect, and so the information that
they ever existed at all is lost.</p>
<p>You can later do things like:</p>
<pre>@c = @it[1..5];
$s = @it[4];
</pre>
<p>...and this may run the iterator to find any values which are only
lazily present.  Values which have already been retrieved from the
iterator are kept available unless they are removed, so if you are
working with a large sequence you may want to:</p>
<pre>shift(@it);
</pre>
<p>Reading and writing indices in a generic lazy list iterator will
force consumption and caching of values for all indices up to and
including the accessed one.</p>
<pre>@it[4] = 2;  # @it[0..3] are cached now, @it[4] was consumed/destroyed
</pre>
<p>Adding to the beginning of the list just stores values without
touching the iterators.</p>
<pre>@it.unshift(&lt;a b c&gt;);  # works as expected
</pre>
<p>Trying to find the number of elements in any way may force
eager consumption of the remainder of the values in the iterator,
and trying to access the end of the list certainly will.</p>
<pre>@it.pop; # Eagerness happens.  Maybe bad things, too.
</pre>
<p>...but you had better be very sure that the list is finite.  Attempts to
fiddle with the end of an infinite list may result in the interpreter
raising quite the exception, in the luckiest cases it may just deliver an
<code>Inf</code>, but in some cases you may find yourself spending a very, very
long time doing laps around the yard.  The exact behavior may be
implementation specific.</p>
<p>So don't do that.</p>
<p>If the list is known to be finite, the generic array iterator will
revert to a normal array once the feed is exhausted.  So it is legal
to:</p>
<pre>@it.push; # eagerly exhausts the feed, then turns into to a normal array
</pre>
<p>...with the same caveats about infinity.</p>
<p>(XXX TODO: effect of type constraints/shape of @it? )</p>
<p>(XXX TODO:</p>
<pre>   my @a = (1,2); @a &lt;&lt;== ... promotes an occupied Positional to
   iterator, right? Should probably be explicitly mentioned.
)



</pre>
</div>
<h2 id="Generic_Lazy_Slice">Generic Lazy Slice</h2>
<div id="Generic_Lazy_Slice_CONTENT">
<p>The generic lazy slice consumes the <code>Parcel</code>s from an iterator but
stores the results as a bi-dimensional list, where the first dimension
corresponds to an iteration, and the second contains the values in
the <code>Parcel</code> returned for that iteration, but turned into a <code>Seq</code> object.
Empty <code>Parcel</code> objects are turned into empty <code>Seq</code> objects.
Any other object is returned as itself.</p>
<p>To obtain a generic lazy slice, end a feed in a sliced binding.</p>
<pre>my **@it &lt;== map { ... }, 1,2,3;
</pre>
<p>Note that in:</p>
<pre>my **@it &lt;== (1,mysub(),2; 1..*);
</pre>
<p>the slice lists are independently lazy.  However, the call to
<code>mysub()</code> is not particularly lazy; it occurs when the parcel is
constructed.  Any laziness is in the function's return value, not in
the call.  A call in the top level of any parcel is called eagerly.
To call a function lazily it is necessary to embed the call in some
other explicitly lazy operator:</p>
<pre>1, (() ... { START mysub() }), 2  # harder way
1, lazy { mysub() }, 2            # easier way
</pre>
<p>[Note: the above text really belongs somewhere else, but I'm too lazy to
figure out where.]</p>
</div>
<h1 id="Coroutines">Coroutines</h1>
<div id="Coroutines_CONTENT">
<p>Perl6 does not have a formally defined sub-style coroutine.  Doubtless
there will be external modules to do so in different flavors.  Such a
construct, where many calls made to the name of a sub with different
parameters, expecting to reach the same sub every time, is not really
compatible with multi-method-dispatch.  While it may suit some
programming styles which only use a subset of the Perl6 language, it
cannot be made generally applicable across the Perl6 feature set.</p>
<p>This is not to say you cannot do coroutines in Perl6.  In fact, the
gather/take construct is a simple coroutine.  But if you want to pass
values back and forth Lua-style, you have to use a suplimentary
object:</p>
<pre> sub my_coro (*@slurp) {
    gather do {
        my Int $initval;
        my Str $secondval;
        my Int $thirdval;
        $initval = shift(@slurp);
        $initval++;
        take $initval;
        $secondval = shift(@slurp);
        take &quot;$initval $secondval&quot;;
        $thirdval = shift(@slurp);
        take $thirdval + $initval;
    }
}
my @a = (1);
my $it;
$it &lt;== my_coro() &lt;== while 1 { shift(@a) };
say &quot;First result: &quot; ~ get $it;
@a.push(&quot;Hello World&quot;);
say &quot;Second result: &quot; ~ get $it;
@a.push(500);
say &quot;Third result: &quot; ~ get $it;
</pre>
<p>...if you want to pass multiple parameters on each call, you can
use a slice slurpy instead, to pass a <code>Capture</code>.</p>
<p>The iterator and array can of course be bundled up to give a more
natural feel:</p>
<pre>class my_sub2coro {
    has $!it = Failure;
    has @!data = ();
    has $.coro;
    submethod BUILD {
        $!it &lt;== &amp;($.coro)() &lt;== while 1 { shift(@!data) };
    }
    method corocall($message) {
        @!data.push($message);
        get $!it;
    }
}
my $c = my_sub2coro.new(coro =&gt; &amp;my_coro);
say &quot;First result&quot; ~ $c.corocall(1);
