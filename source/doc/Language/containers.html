<p>This article started as a conversion on IRC explaining the difference between the <code>Array</code> and the <code>List</code> type in Perl 6. It explains the levels of indirection involved in dealing with variables and container elements.</p>
<h2 id="What_is_a_variable?"><a class="u" href="#___top" title="go to top of document">What is a variable?</a></h2>
<p>Some people like to say &quot;everything is an object&quot;, but in fact a variable is not a user-exposed object in Perl 6.</p>
<p>When the compiler encounters a variable declaration like <code>my $x</code>, it registers it in some internal symbol table. This internal symbol table is used to detect undeclared variables, and to tie the code generation for the variable to the correct scope.</p>
<p>At run time, a variable appears as an entry in a <em>lexical pad</em>, or <em>lexpad</em> for short. This is a per-scope data structure that stores a pointer for each variable.</p>
<p>In the case of <code>my $x</code>, the lexpad entry for the variable <code>$x</code> is a pointer to an object of type <code>Scalar</code>, usually just called <em>the container</em>.</p>
<h2 id="Scalar_containers"><a class="u" href="#___top" title="go to top of document">Scalar containers</a></h2>
<p>Although objects of type <code>Scalar</code> are everywhere in Perl 6, you usually never see them directly as objects, because most operations <em>decontainerize</em>, which means they act on the <code>Scalar</code> container&#39;s contents instead of the container itself.</p>
<p>In a code like</p>
<pre>my $x = 42;
say $x;</pre>
<p>the assignment <code>$x = 42</code> stores a pointer to the <code>Int</code> object 42 in the scalar container to which the lexpad entry for <code>$x</code> points.</p>
<p>The assignment operator asks the container on the left to store the value on its right. What exactly that means is up to the container type. For <code>Scalar</code> it means &quot;replace the previously stored value with the new one&quot;.</p>
<p>Note that subroutine signatures allow passing around of containers:</p>
<pre>sub f($a is rw) {
    $a = 23;
}
my $x = 42;
f($x);
say $x;         # 23</pre>
<p>Inside the subroutine, the lexpad entry for <code>$a</code> points to the same container that <code>$x</code> points to outside the subroutine. Which is why assignment to <code>$a</code> also modifies the contents of <code>$x</code>.</p>
<p>Likewise a routine can return a container if it is marked as <code>is rw</code>:</p>
<pre>my $x = 23;
sub f() is rw { $x };
f() = 42;
say $x;         # 42</pre>
<p>For explicit returns, <code>return-rw</code> instead of <code>return</code> must be used.</p>
<p>Returning a container is how <code>is rw</code> attribute accessors work. So</p>
<pre>class A {
    has $.attr is rw;
}</pre>
<p>is equivalent to</p>
<pre>class A {
    has $!attr;
    method attr() is rw { $!attr }
}</pre>
<h2 id="Binding"><a class="u" href="#___top" title="go to top of document">Binding</a></h2>
<p>Next to assignment, Perl 6 also supports <em>binding</em> with the <code>:=</code> operator. When binding a value or a container to a variable, the lexpad entry of the variable is modified (and not just the container it points to). If you write</p>
<pre>my $x := 42;</pre>
<p>then the lexpad entry for <code>$x</code> directly points to the <code>Int</code> 42. Which means that you cannot assign to it anymore:</p>
<pre>$ perl6 -e &#39;my $x := 42; $x = 23&#39;
Cannot modify an immutable value
   in block  at -e:1</pre>
<p>You can also bind variables to other variables:</p>
<pre>my $a = 0;
my $b = 0;
$a := $b;
$b = 42;
say $a;         # 42</pre>
<p>Here after the initial binding, the lexpad entries for <code>$a</code> and <code>$b</code> both point to the same scalar container, so assigning to one variable also changes the contents of the other.</p>
<p>You&#39;ve seen this situation before: it is exactly what happened with the signature parameter marked as <code>is rw</code>.</p>
<h2 id="Scalar_Containers_and_Listy_Things"><a class="u" href="#___top" title="go to top of document">Scalar Containers and Listy Things</a></h2>
<p>There are a number of positional container types with slightly different semantics in Perl 6. The most basic one is <em>Parcel</em>, short for <em>Parenthesis cell</em>. It is created by the comma operator, and often delimited by round parenthesis -- hence the name.</p>
<pre>say (1, 2, 3).WHAT;     # (Parcel)</pre>
<p>A parcel is immutable, which means you cannot change the number of elements in a parcel. But if one of the elements happens to be a scalar container, you can still assign to it:</p>
<pre>my $x = 42;
($x, 1, 2)[0] = 23;
say $x;                 # 23
($x, 1, 2)[1] = 23;     # Error: Cannot modify an immutable value</pre>
<p>So the parcel doesn&#39;t care about whether its elements are values or containers, they just store and retrieve whatever was given to them.</p>
<p>A <code>List</code> has the same attitude of indifference towards containers. But it allows modifying the length (for example with <code>push</code>, <code>pop</code>, <code>shift</code> and <code>unshift</code>), and it is also lazy.</p>
<p>An <code>Array</code> is just like a list, except that it forces all its elements to be containers. Thus you can say</p>
<pre>my @a = 1, 2, 3;
@a[0] = 42;
say @a;         # 42 2 3</pre>
<p>and <code>@a</code> actually stores three scalar containers. <code>@a[0]</code> returns one of them, and the assignment operator replaces the integer value stored in that container with the new one, <code>42</code>.</p>
<h2 id="Assigning_and_Binding_to_Array_Variables"><a class="u" href="#___top" title="go to top of document">Assigning and Binding to Array Variables</a></h2>
<p>Assigning to a scalar variable and to an array variable both do basically the same thing: discard the old value(s), and enter some new value(s).</p>
<p>Still it&#39;s easy to observe how different they are:</p>
<pre>my $x = 42; say $x.WHAT;    # (Int)
my @a = 42; say @a.WHAT;    # (Array)</pre>
<p>This is because the <code>Scalar</code> container type hides itself well, but <code>Array</code> makes no such effort.</p>
<p>To place a non-<code>Array</code> into an array variable, binding works:</p>
<pre>my @a := (1, 2, 3);
say @a.WHAT;                # (Parcel)</pre>
<h2 id="Binding_to_Array_Elements"><a class="u" href="#___top" title="go to top of document">Binding to Array Elements</a></h2>
<p>As a curious side note, Perl 6 supports binding to array elements:</p>
<pre>my @a = (1, 2, 3);
@a[0] := my $x;
$x = 42;
say @a;                     # 42 2 3</pre>
<p>If you&#39;ve read and understood the previous explanations, it is now time to wonder how this can possibly work. After all, binding to a variable requires a lexpad entry for that variable, and while there is one for an array, there aren&#39;t lexpad entries for each array element (you cannot expand the lexpad at run time).</p>
<p>The answer is that binding to array elements is recognized at the syntax level, and instead of emitting code for a normal binding operation, a special method on the array is called that knows how to do the binding itself.</p>
<h2 id="Flattening,_Items_and_Containers"><a class="u" href="#___top" title="go to top of document">Flattening, Items and Containers</a></h2>
<p>The <code>%</code> and <code>@</code> sigils in Perl 6 generally indicate flattening. That means that flattening list context iterates over them as if there was no container boundary:</p>
<pre>my @a = 1, 2, 3;
my @b = @a, 4, 5;
say @b.elems;               # 5
say @b.join: &#39;|&#39;;           # 1|2|3|4|5</pre>
<p>Here <code>@a</code> is flattened out in the second line.</p>
<p>Item containers prevent flattening, thus allowing the programmer to write nested data structures.</p>
<p>The following examples all do the same, and do not flatten:</p>
<pre>my @a = 1, 2, 3;
my @b = @a.item, 4, 5;
   @b = $(@a), 4, 5;
   @b = $@a, 4, 5;
   @b = [1, 2, 3], 4, 5;</pre>
<pre>my $item = @a;
   @b = $item, 4, 5;</pre>
<pre>say @b.perl;            # Array.new([1, 2, 3], 4, 5);</pre>
<p><code>[...]</code> creates an itemized array, and <code>Array.new(...)</code> a non-itemized array.</p>
<p>There is a slight exception though: if you call a method on an itemized container, it will generally behave as if it weren&#39;t itemized. So <code>[1, 2, 3].join(&#39;,&#39;)</code> produces <code>&quot;1,2,3&quot;</code> as a result, as one might hope.</p>
<p>This also means that calling the <code>.list</code> method flattens out an itemized container:</p>
<pre>my $item = [1, 2, 3]; 
my @b = $item.list, 4, 5;    # 5 elems
   @b = @($item), 4, 5;      # a shortcut
   @b = @$item, 4, 5;        # another shortcut</pre>
<p>Other methods on lists also return flat lists/parcels, so for example</p>
<pre>my $item = [1, 2, 3]; 
my @b = $item.sort, 4, 5;    # 5 elems</pre>
<p>sorts the elements of <code>$item</code> and then returns a list that is flattened out in the array assignment.</p>
<p>Note that <code>.list</code> de-itemizes only the invocant; it does not recursively flatten the whole data structure. For example in</p>
<pre>my @a = [1, [2, 3, 4]].list;
say @a.elems;               # 2</pre>
<p>the <code>.list</code> only de-itemizes the outer brackets, the inner ones create an array that is stored in the second element of the Array, and is not touched by <code>.list</code>.</p>
<h3 id="Non-flattening_contexts"><a class="u" href="#___top" title="go to top of document">Non-flattening contexts</a></h3>
<p>In the examples above, it was always assignment to an array variable that flattened out non-itemized arrays. But sometimes you want to preserve the structure.</p>
<p>The most common case (and one of the reasons for the whole flattening vs. non-flattening distinction to exist) is to have some list-like operator that could conceivably return either a flat list, or a list of lists. Consider the zip operator <code>Z</code>, which takes an element from each list like a zipper:</p>
<pre>my @left  = &lt;a b c&gt;;
my @right = 1, 2, 3;</pre>
<pre>my @flat = @left Z @right;
my @tree = (@left Z @right).tree;</pre>
<p>The expression <code>@left Z @right</code> returns <code>((&#39;a&#39;, 1), (&#39;b&#39;, 2), (&#39;c&#39;, 3))</code>. In a flattening context like array assignment, that flattens out into a list of 6 elements, <code>(&#39;a&#39;, 1, &#39;b&#39;, 2, &#39;c&#39;, 3)</code>. But if you want to preserve the structure, you can append .tree, and it returns the array</p>
<pre>[&#39;a&#39;, 1], [&#39;b&#39;, 2], [&#39;c&#39;, 3]</pre>
<p>On the other hand, assigning (or binding) to a scalar preserves the structure without itemizing any inner arrays or lists:</p>
<pre>my $x = (&lt;a b c&gt; Z &lt;D E F&gt;);
say $x.perl;                # ((&quot;a&quot;, &quot;D&quot;), (&quot;b&quot;, &quot;E&quot;), (&quot;c&quot;, &quot;F&quot;)).list.item</pre>
<p>Again <code>.tree</code> can turn the inner parcels into &quot;hard&quot;, itemized arrays:</p>
<pre>say $x.tree.perl;           # ([&quot;a&quot;, &quot;D&quot;], [&quot;b&quot;, &quot;E&quot;], [&quot;c&quot;, &quot;F&quot;]).list</pre>
<p>What happens when you call <code>$x.list</code>?</p>
<pre>say $x.list.perl;           # ((&quot;a&quot;, &quot;D&quot;), (&quot;b&quot;, &quot;E&quot;), (&quot;c&quot;, &quot;F&quot;)).list</pre>
<p>It just returned the same object without the outer <code>.item</code> container, but didn&#39;t look inside the list. If that&#39;s what you want, there is another utility method called <code>flat</code>:</p>
<pre>say $x.flat.perl            # (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;F&quot;).list</pre>
<p>To reiterate the previous point: <code>.list</code> only removes the itemization (or scalar container) of the invocant, whereas <code>.flat</code> walks the elements of the invocant, and removes their itemization (note that both methods don&#39;t modify the invocant object; they just return a modified copy).</p>
<h3 id="What_flattens,_what_doesn't?"><a class="u" href="#___top" title="go to top of document">What flattens, what doesn&#39;t?</a></h3>
<p>In general, operations that have to iterate the list usually flatten the list. Other operations don&#39;t. Here is a list of a few operations that flattens:</p>
<ul><ul><li><p>.map, .grep, .first</p>
</li>
<li><p>Iteration with &quot;for&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>.join</p>
</li>
<li><p>assignment to an array variable</p>
</li>
<li><p>assignment to a hash variable</p>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>And a few that don&#39;t flatten:</p>
<ul><ul><li><p>Indexing with [$idx]</p>
</li>
<li><p>.elems</p>
</li>
<li><p>.tree</p>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>The first two cannot flatten, otherwise it would be very hard to get access to the structure that&#39;s actually stored in the list or parcel, and the whole point of <code>.tree</code> is to not flatten.</p>
