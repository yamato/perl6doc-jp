<p>This is a draft document. Many of these functions will work as in Perl
5, except we're trying to rationalize everything into roles.  For
now you can assume most of the important functions will automatically
be in the * namespace.  However, with IO operations in particular,
many of them are really methods on an IO handle, and if there is a
corresponding global function, it's merely an exported version of
the method.</p>

<h2 id="Overridable_IO_handles">Overridable IO handles</h2>
<div id="Overridable_IO_handles_CONTENT">
<p>In Perl 6, there are the <i>standard</i> IO handles, and any number of overriding
inner filehandles for the same symbol.</p>
<p>The <i>standard</i> handles are our old familiar friends (with new names).
Standard input changed from STDIN to <code>$*IN</code>, standard output changed
from STDOUT to <code>$*OUT</code>, and standard error changed from STDERR to
<code>$*ERR</code>.  In Perl 6 these symbols represent more of a concept than
a given filehandle, since the meaning is contextually determined.
The process's version of these handles live in the <code>PROCESS::</code>
namespace, which is more global than the per-interpreter <code>GLOBAL::</code>
namespace.</p>
<p>When no explicit filehandle is used, the standard IO operators are
defined in terms of the dynamic variables.  So the <code>print</code> function
prints to <code>$*OUT</code>, while <code>warn</code> warns to <code>$*ERR</code>.  The <code>lines()</code>
term inputs from <code>$*ARGFILES</code> which defaults to <code>$*IN</code> in the absence of any
filenames.  So any given dynamic scope (interpreter,
thread, function or method call) may redefine the current meaning of
any of those filehandles within the dynamic scope of itself and of
its called routines.</p>
<p>So to put it another way, when you write something like</p>
<pre>say &quot;Howdy, world!&quot;
</pre>
<p>the <code>say</code> function looks for the current meaning of <code>$*OUT</code>, and
takes the closest definition it can find in its callers.  If none
of the callers have overridden the definition, it looks in the
interpreter's <code>GLOBAL</code> namespace.  If the interpreter hasn't overridden
the meaning, it takes the meaning from <code>PROCESS</code>.  In essence, any
dynamic scope in Perl 6 is allowed to do IO redirection much like
a Unix shell does with its subprocesses, albeit with a different
syntax:</p>
<pre>{
    temp $*OUT = open $newfile, :w;
    foo() # all stdout goes to $newfile
}
# stdout reverts to outer scope's definition
</pre>
</div>
<h2 id="Roles_and_Classes">Roles and Classes</h2>
<div id="Roles_and_Classes_CONTENT">
<p>The roles and classes that define most of the functionality for IO are defined in
S32-setting-library/IO.pod.  The main functions used are listed in S29 with references to
S32-setting-library/IO.pod.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="Special_Quoting_Syntax">Special Quoting Syntax</h2>
<div id="Special_Quoting_Syntax_CONTENT">
<p>The use of filenames requires a special quoting syntax.  It works as follows:</p>
<pre>qp{/path/to/file}
q:p{/path/to/file}
</pre>
<p>Both of the above result in the same thing.  </p>
<p>The quote characters can be any of the usual ones, although / is probably a bad choice
for filenames.  </p>
<p>The code shown above returns a Path object (or a descendant thereof).  </p>
<p>Naturally you can also ask for interpolation in filenames:</p>
<pre>qp:qq{$directory/$file}
qq:p{$directory/$file}
</pre>
<p>There are a number of special adverbs that can be applied to the file quoting 
operator.  Most of these are filesystem-specific.  They confine what can be
included in a filename.  </p>
<p>Any path that starts with a &quot;/&quot; is considered an absolute path, otherwise
the path is considered relative.  </p>
<p>When creating a path with qp{}, the Path.Encoding attribute is set to $?ENC, unless
the :bin modifier (see below) is used.  </p>
</div>
<h3 id="Default_constraints">Default constraints</h3>
<div id="Default_constraints_CONTENT">
<p>The default constraints can be set with the &quot;use path&quot; pragma, for example:</p>
<pre>use path :posix;
use path :modern;
use path :local;
</pre>
<p>The default when in strict mode is &quot;use path :posix&quot;, whereas the default in 
lax mode is &quot;use path :local&quot;.  </p>
</div>
<h3 id="posix_constraints">:posix constraints</h3>
<div id="posix_constraints_CONTENT">
<p>The :modern set of constraints paths are portable POSIX paths (see POSIX.1-2008 sections
4.7 and 3.276).  If platform/filesystem specific behavior is needed,
specific constraints should be applied as needed (see below).  </p>
<p>The default constraints are to only allow &quot;/&quot; as separator and only allows 
portable POSIX filenames.  That means A-Z, a-z, 0-9, &lt;period&gt;, &lt;underscore&gt;,
and &lt;hyphen&gt;.  Additionally, hyphen may not be the first character in the path.  </p>
<p>Any path that starts with a &quot;/&quot; is considered an absolute path, otherwise
the path is considered relative.  </p>
</div>
<h3 id="portable">:portable</h3>
<div id="portable_CONTENT">
<p>In addition to the POSIX constraints above, the path should fit into 8 
characters, followed by a full stop, and then three more characters.  Only 
the one full stop should appear in the filename.  Additionally, no path
may be longer than 64 characters.  </p>
</div>
<h3 id="local">:local</h3>
<div id="local_CONTENT">
<p>This is :win on a Windows platform, :unix on a Unix platform, etc.  Note 
that this is specifically not portable between platforms with different
constraint sets.  </p>
</div>
<h3 id="modern_constraints">:modern constraints</h3>
<div id="modern_constraints_CONTENT">
<p>The :modern set of constraints are the same as :posix, except that they
may contain any UTF-8 character, rather than just those listed.  </p>
</div>
<h3 id="win_constraints">:win constraints</h3>
<div id="win_constraints_CONTENT">
<p>We allow Windows style paths so converting and maintaining code on this
platform is not a pain.</p>
<p>my Path $path = p:win{C:\Program Files\MS Access\file.file};</p>
<p>Note that this specifically excludes the backslash quoting usually used with 
q{}.  </p>
</div>
<h3 id="unix_constraints">:unix constraints</h3>
<div id="unix_constraints_CONTENT">
<p>For Unix specific behavior we have a p:unix{} literal.  Here the only
limits are what is defined by the locale and the filesystem type. So we won't 
be able to write full Unicode if locale is set to Latin1. </p>
<p>my Path $path = p:unix{/usr/src/bla/myfile?:%.file};</p>
</div>
<h3 id="bin_constraints_no_constraints_at_al">:bin constraints (no constraints at all)</h3>
<div id="bin_constraints_no_constraints_at_al-2">
<p>If the above are causing problems, p:bin{} can be used as no checking is
done here.  However, this leaves the Path.Encoding attribute undefined, which 
means that certain features of Path will remain unavailable unless this 
attribute is set.  </p>
</div>
<h3 id="Other_constraints">Other constraints</h3>
<div id="Other_constraints_CONTENT">
<p>It is expected that other sets of constraints, such as VMS, DOS, and old-style
Mac will be provided by modules.  </p>
</div>
<h2 id="CWD">$*CWD</h2>
<div id="CWD_CONTENT">
<p>The global variable $*CWD is a Path object with certain special properties, 
mainly:</p>
<pre> * It must check whether the path exists before changing its value
 * It can only be assigned an absolute path; if you want to make relative 
   changes, use the Array interface
</pre>
<p>$*CWD is specific to the current thread, unlike <code>%*ENV&lt;PATH&gt;</code> or the
native getcwd/chdir path, which are both usually process-wide.</p>
<p>The variable is used in at least these cases:</p>
<pre> * When a Path object is created, if the string it is given is not an
   absolute path, then $*CWD is prepended to it.
 * When a subprocess is executed, it is executed with the current
   thread's $*CWD as its working directory.
